# UKFonGPU
Unscented Kalman Filter implementation on GPU using OpenCL and Eigen Linear algebra library for c++

Notes on Toolchain:
This project was created and compile in Code::Blocks 17.12.

There is a CPU implementation of this code and an OpenCL implementation. You need to include the Eigen libraries for linear algebra as all matrix manipulations are done using Eigen.
For the OpenCL/Parallel implementation, you have to include the CL header files.
